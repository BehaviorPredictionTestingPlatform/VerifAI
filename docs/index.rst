############################################
Welcome to VerifAI's documentation!
############################################

We present VerifAI, a software toolkit for the formal design and analysis of systems that include artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) components. VerifAI particularly seeks to address challenges with applying formal methods to perception and ML components, including those based on neural networks, and to model and analyze system behavior in the presence of environment uncertainty. VerifAI centers on simulation guided by formal models and specifications. Several use cases are illustrated with examples, including temporal-logic falsification, model-based systematic fuzz testing, parameter synthesis, counterexample analysis, and data set augmentation.

Here is the associated paper `VerifAI <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-25540-4_25>`_: A Toolkit for the Formal Design and Analysis of Artificial Intelligence-Based Systems. (arXiv version `here <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04245.pdf>`_)

If you have any problems using VerifAI, please contact Shromona Ghosh at shromona.ghosh@berkeley.edu or Daniel Fremont at dfremont@ucsc.edu, or submit an issue to the GitHub repository.
