# About VerifAI

We present **VerifAI**, a software toolkit for the formal design and analysis of 
systems that include artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
components. **VerifAI** particularly seeks to address challenges with applying
formal methods to perception and ML components, including those based on 
neural networks, and to model and analyze
system behavior in the presence of environment uncertainty.
**VerifAI** centers on simulation guided by formal models and specifications. 
Several use cases are illustrated with examples, including temporal-logic falsification,
model-based systematic fuzz testing, parameter synthesis, counterexample analysis,
and data set augmentation. Please refer to this [documentation](https://verifai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
